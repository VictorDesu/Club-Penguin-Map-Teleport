Club Penguin was a great game that I loved to play as a kid. Unfortunately, it was officially closed in 2017. 

This mini project is a very simple simulation of how the map teleport worked in the original game. 
There is still a lot to be done, like:
-Upgrade the quality of the images
-Implement a player and make it possible to walk in the maps
-Implement the original music themes of each map

<h1>How to teleport</h1>
1) Click in the map icon
2) Choose and click in the map you want to go (still have some maps to implement)

Please enjoy and feel free to modify as much as you want to.
