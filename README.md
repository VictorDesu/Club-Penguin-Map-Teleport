Club Penguin was a great game that I loved to play as a kid. Unfortunately, it was officially closed in 2017. 

This mini project is a very simple simulation of how the map teleport worked in the original game. 
There is still a lot to be done, like:
-Upgrade the quality of the images
-Implement a player and make it possible to walk in the maps
-Implement the original music themes of each map

Please enjoy and feel free to modify as much as you want to.
