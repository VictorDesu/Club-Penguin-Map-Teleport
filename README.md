Club Penguin was a great game that I loved to play as a kid. Unfortunately, it was officially closed in 2017. 

This mini project is a very simple simulation of how the map teleport worked in the original game. 
There is still a lot to be done, like:
<br>-Upgrade the quality of the images
<br>-Implement a player and make it possible to walk in the maps
<br>-Implement the original music themes of each map

<h3>How to teleport</h3>
1) Click in the map icon <br>
2) Choose and click in the map you want to go (still have some maps to implement)

<br>Please enjoy and feel free to modify as much as you want to.
